Dataset: https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

This repository contains SQL queries and analysis related to LEGO production. The provided SQL code explores various aspects of LEGO production data, including set characteristics, themes, and trends over time.

## Description

The SQL code in this repository performs analysis on a dataset containing information about LEGO sets and themes. The code is structured into sections, each addressing specific questions or tasks related to LEGO production and sales.

### Sections:

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Queries to retrieve all columns from the 'sets' and 'themes' tables.

2. **Top Sets by Part Count:**
   - Identifies the top 5 sets with the most LEGO parts, providing insights into the complexity of LEGO sets.

3. **Theme with Most Sets:**
   - Determines the theme with the highest number of sets, indicating the most prolific theme in the LEGO product lineup.

4. **Sets Released Between 2018 and 2023:**
   - Finds sets released within the specified timeframe, including theme ID, theme name, set number, set name, and release year, to understand recent LEGO releases.

5. **Average Part Count Per Year:**
   - Calculates the average part count of LEGO sets for each year, showing trends in set complexity over time.

6. **Top Themes by Average Part Count:**
   - Identifies the top 5 themes with the highest average part count, providing insights into the complexity of sets within different themes.

7. **Set Size Categorization:**
   - Categorizes sets into small, medium, or large based on their part count, allowing for analysis of set size distribution.

8. **Sets with Similar Part Counts:**
   - Finds sets with similar part counts, potentially revealing patterns or clusters in LEGO set designs.

9. **LEGO Set Growth Rate:**
   - Calculates the year-over-year growth rate of LEGO sets, providing insights into the expansion or contraction of LEGO production over time.

## Usage

To use this code:
1. Ensure you have access to a database containing LEGO production data.
2. Execute the SQL queries in your database environment.
3. Analyze the results to gain insights into LEGO production trends and patterns.

Feel free to modify the queries or adapt them to suit your specific analysis needs.
